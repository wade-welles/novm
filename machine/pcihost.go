// PciHostBridge --
//
// This is an example of PCI-to-PCI bridge.
// It's not particularly well though-out, or sensible.
// We'd probably want to chain a second PCI bus device
// behind it somehow.
//
// As it stands, we're not going to use this bridge.
// AFAIK the reason the CPU doesn't access all PCI devices
// directly is because there is an electrical limit on
// building PCI buses with too many devices. But this is
// a VMM, so we don't have any electrical limits. :)
